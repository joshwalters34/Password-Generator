# Password-Generator
This website is designed to give a user the ability to create a unique password.  The user is prompted to enter a password length, then asked if they would like to include lowercase letter, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters in their password.  These variations will allow the user to create a password that is as secure as they need.

## Motivation
My motivation for this website was to design something simple and easy to allow users to generate a password.  Strong passwords are vital to ensure that your data is kept secure and doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
